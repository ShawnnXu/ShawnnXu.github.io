Brief Biography
======
Xiangyu Xu is currently a Ph.D. candidate of Computer Science and Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Jiadi Yu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jdyu/) and Prof. Minglu Li. He received his B.E. degree in Automation from [Sichuan University](http://scu.edu.cn) in 2016. Previously, he has visited [Wireless Information Network Laboratory (WINLAB)](http://winlab.rutgers.edu/) and [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Rutgers University](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yingying Chen](http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~yychen/) (IEEE Fellow).



Research Interests
======
His research interests include **mobile sensing & computing**, **human-machine interactions**, and **cyber security & privacy**. He mainly focus on combining machine learning and data mining methods with signal processing techniques to realize futuristic applications, as well as revealing the potential security problems. Besides the algorithm development, his work has a strong emphasis on system implementation and validation in real-world scenarios.
